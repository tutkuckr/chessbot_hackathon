The Challenge
Think youâ€™ve got what it takes to build a chess-bot that can outplay the competition? 

The ChessBot Hackathon is your chance to put your coding skills to the test! Writing a chess-bot is a challenging, fun, and educational experience. From optimization and testing to algorithms and debugging, there is a lot to learn and do.

In this hackathon, you'll build a chess-bot that is capable of playing standard chess, and at the end, have them compete against each other.
